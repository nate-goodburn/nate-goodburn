Hi, I’m Nate Goodburn. I’m a WordPress and PHP developer from Montana with a deep fondness for math and music. I spend a lot of time teaching myself the way things work, and also love to play guitar, listen to baseball, carve spoons, mix cocktails, and sit in canoes and rafts with those I love.

You can reach out to me at nate@goodburn.dev

I'm currently learning more about:
- NLP and fast searching through text
- Backend design patterns
- Knuckleball pitch grips
